Script docker_ce_install.sh will  install docker on Amazon AWS Ubuntu server.

Next is to create user and group than logout the session and login back again.

sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

To check docker is accessible into your user

run
> docker ps

you should see
ubuntu@############:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

Empty list

Good to go.
